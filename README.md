-------------------------- // To use the app // --------------------------

• First remove your existing custom crosshairs folder from the tf/custom folder 
(this is important because the app works in a way that may be incompatible with your existing files)

• Next copy the new crosshairs folder into tf/custom, if you don't have a custom folder in tf then make one first

• Place the application itself wherever you like on your computer

• Start the app and select the crosshairs folder (that you just copied) when prompted, you may also change your directory using the menubar on the top left

• To use the app work from the top downwards selecting first the classes you want, then the weapons, then the crosshair

• Press the Apply button to save your changes, you may then press the Reset button and repeat for as many times as you like


------------------- // Adding more custom crosshairs // -------------------

You may add any additional vtf files to crosshairs/materials/vgui/replay/thumbnails/ (no need to add any vmt files, as the app generates these).
Once you have added your additional vtf files you should reference them in crosshairs/custom_crosshairs.txt, line by line like so;

myCrosshair1
myCrosshair2
myCrosshair3
etc...

------------- // If you need to change your script files // -------------

This application works by generating vmt files, the reason this is incompatible with existing custom files is because most custom configs work with
generated weapon script files instead, and leave the vmt files (which point to the location of the vtf pictures).

If you want to change one of your weapon script files using generated files from cfg.tf (for example to change the explosion effect) then you must make
sure that you manually change the "crosshair" part of the file to match it's name.

For example the rocket launcher has a script file named "tf_weapon_rocketlauncher.txt" and it's "crosshair" is named to match like so;

		"crosshair"
		{
				"file"		"vgui/replay/thumbnails/tf_weapon_rocketlauncher"
				"x"		"0"
				"y"		"0"
				"width"		"64"
				"height"	"64"
		}

This will then point it to the correct vmt file generated by the application.
